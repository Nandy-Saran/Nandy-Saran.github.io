Chennai is a big city, which you can never finish exploring. I did my undergrad in Coimbatore, so I didn’t get the chance to explore Chennai a lot.

The one time I went there was for exams and internships, which were all less than a month. During my campus placements, I knew I would either end up being in Chennai or Bangalore, because there’s where most IT companies are.

I got placed in Chennai. The whole city was new to me. Luckily, the place has trains which are super cheap. You can get to far away places with just Rs.10! How cool is that?

One late evening, I hopped on the electric train and my destination was Guindy. It was around 40 minutes far from Perungalathur. I enjoyed night travels mostly. The cool breeze, a window seat and soothing music are all you need in a travel. Occasionally, if there are kids near, I talk and play with them.

Sadly, I dint have my earphones that day. I had to keep myself occupied for about 45 minutes. Chennai trains have loads of vendors who sell their goods in a cheap rate. There were two ladies who were selling pudhina at a really good price. Since it was a ladies compartment, the lady had good sales.

Next to me were seated was a girl who was in her early twenties. She asked a nearby person :

    “Akka, Pudhina curry epdi vaikrathu?” means ” How to cook Pudhina curry?”

There were three of them who answered. You won’t believe the coincidence. One spoke Malayalam, one spoke Hindi and another spoke Telugu. I was astounded to see four people near me from four different states. Actually, no one could get a word other than ‘Pudhina‘. They kinda guessed her question and started to give recipes.

The next 20 minutes, I listened to four different ways on how Pudhina curry could be made. This made me wonder how diverse the place is. It is more lovely to see how the people mingle to help each other. No matter how much we blame the country or the government, there are some things no country can ever steal from India. You can blame the constitution how much ever you want, but don’t blame the country. It is a unique and friendly country.

The next 10 minutes, I talked to each one of them and chit chatted for a while. My station came up, and only then I realised how near Guindy was. Time goes by, when you have interesting conversations. You are probably never going to meet this people again, but you can feel happy that you made someone else happy. And in this era where children engage more in Youtube and Instagram stories, you can be prove them that conversations are more fun!
