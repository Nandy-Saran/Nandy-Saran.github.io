There are so many times when people say that, this is just a temporary phase. It is true. The best thing about life is that it is dynamic. There is something new each day, even if your routine is the same old one. If you look closely, you will notice the difference each day makes in your life.

But, sometimes we don’t have the strength to look into the positivity.  It is painful when sadness strikes all of a sudden. So we choose to be sad all the time. As I was saying, this is just a phase. There is some new chapter, near or far. But that chapter starts with you.

Have you wondered how you could make a difference in other people’s lives? Have you happily made someone else happy? Have you considered taking that step? No, many of us don’t. We leave our past to decide our future. We never try to change, because we are scared. How many times have you talked to that lady who cleans your office? How many times have you played with a child? When was the last time you colored a picture? When did you wholeheartedly laugh? When did you pray? When did you sit in peace?

    Time is running. Make the most of it.

People say. Nowadays, we are making the most out of it. True, but are we doing it for ourselves?  Every weekend is not to enjoy but to complete some of the Monday work beforehand, to be free later. Then on Monday night, Tuesday’s work kicks in. You are saving your time to do the next day’s work and you eventually lose the time you had been saving so long. This is what people at work regularly do.

A break is what you need now. I am not talking about a long trip to the Himalayas, but some quality time for yourself.  Each person has a different meaning associated with ‘break’. But, in general, it is that time when you feel happy. Happiness is peace of mind. If reading a book is your break, sit back and read. If cooking is your break, cook and feed the people you love. It is those things that matter. Do what you do best, and feel peaceful. This quality time can’t be done every day, but when you feel low, this hobby might be your escape.

So, this weekend, stop binge-watching all those series on Netflix. Go to the nearby park, see children, talk with them and be happy.  Visit your parents, switch off your phones and have a feast. Hear music and go on a walk with your pet dog. Talk to an old school friend and go down the memory lane.
