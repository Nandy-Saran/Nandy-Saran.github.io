           Writing is my reality-escape. In India, writing can be taken as a profession only if you have a kick ass college story which
           people would love to read. But,unfortunately, my college life was nothing like Two States or Five Point Someone. It was a normal
            college life with a normal routine. The best part about my life is that it is different each day. I have stories to tell too.
            And, luckily I know to write. A little. So this page is going to be filled with articles on a lot of things. Sometimes it is
            life lessons and other times it is about pointers, and maybe even installation guides. Hope you like them! Do leave in comments
            and suggestions to nandhus05@gmail.com or in my Instagram handle @nandys_blog.
