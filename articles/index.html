    <h2> How to survive in GCT </h2>
    <h6> A Must Read for the newbies </h6>
    <br> <br>
    
    <p> Hi there. Welcome to GCT. Without further ado, I will tell you everything you need to know about the place. <br>
        GCT is a wonderful place to be, in terms of nature. I assure you this place has no artifical tress of any sort and doesn't
        bother even a little about decor. So, if you are expecting to study in a high-tech environment with glass doors and high
        buildings, better transfer to some other college or win Super Singer and get an Arun Excello flat.</p>
    <br>
    <p> You must be toppers, to state the fact. You must be those 1100+ mark students, and know a lot. But,let me assure you, your
        marks are going to help you only on your first day. By the end of the first semester, you would have forgotten everything about
        Benzene or Bragg's spectrometer. Despite learning the two Physics textbooks in your higher secondary, Physics here will be different
        and all new. The second thing is the <b>medium</b> you must have studied in. There will a class where they ask you that question and
        despite the answer, you are treated the same. So, don't worry. You won't be ignored by the crowd. </p>
    <p> Now I will give you tips on how to survive here.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h6>1. At first, you will be homesick.A lot</h6>
    <p> People from GCT are rarely from the place. It is a diverse mix of people, and because of that people don't usually start to
        mingle on the very first day. This usually happens in every college. And if you are a hosteller,take my word for it. The best thing
        about Coimbatore is travel around the city is cheap. You get buses to any place, any time. Going to your hometown is not as difficult 
        as you may feel, except if you are from those far-away cities(like Rameshwaram, Tirunelveli,Hosur and all). Homesick is a phase.
        At first, I have seen friends who go home every week. These Tirupur and Erode people will make you feel jealous as going to home for
        them is way too easy. They'll be like, "Na veetuku poren di" and by the time you reach Singanallur busstand, they'll be at their home
        eating dinner. So you have to cope up with that. It would be great to go with your friends. You chit chat and then you fall asleep.
        But,on the contrary the best part about going alone is hearing songs. Never forget your headset unless you are ready to listen to 90's
        songs in the bus. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Girls out there. One important thing is that going home is easy, but the process behind it is actually difficult. There should
        be a card sent from your hometown which has details of your name,time of stay and the place. The worst part is waiting for it to come.
        It would be better if we had our own owls, just like Harry did. But that aint gonna happen. So make sure you remind your forgetful parents
        that you live far away and they have to send a card each time. Parents usually forget because they got rid of the only nuisance in the 
        house. Kidding.
