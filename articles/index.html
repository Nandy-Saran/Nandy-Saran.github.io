    <h2> How to survive in GCT </h2><br>
    <h6> A Must Read for the newbies </h6>
    <br> <br>
    
    <p> Hi there. Welcome to GCT. Without further ado, I will tell you everything you need to know about the place. <br>
        GCT is a wonderful place to be, in terms of nature. I assure you this place has no artifical tress of any sort and doesn't
        bother even a little about decor. So, if you are expecting to study in a high-tech environment with glass doors and high
        buildings, better transfer to some other college or win Super Singer and get an Arun Excello flat.</p>
    <br>
    <p> You must be toppers, to state the fact. You must be those 1100+ mark students, and know a lot. But,let me assure you, your
        marks are going to help you only on your first day. By the end of the first semester, you would have forgotten everything about
        Benzene or Bragg's spectrometer. Despite learning the two Physics textbooks in your higher secondary, Physics here will be different
        and all new. The second thing is the <b>medium</b> you must have studied in. There will a class where they ask you that question and
        despite the answer, you are treated the same. So, don't worry. You won't be ignored by the crowd. </p>
    <p> Now I will give you tips on how to survive here.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>1. At first, you will be homesick.A lot</h3>
    <p> People from GCT are rarely from the place. It is a diverse mix of people, and because of that people don't usually start to
        mingle on the very first day. This usually happens in every college. And if you are a hosteller,take my word for it. The best thing
        about Coimbatore is travel around the city is cheap. You get buses to any place, any time. Going to your hometown is not as difficult 
        as you may feel, except if you are from those far-away cities(like Rameshwaram, Tirunelveli,Hosur and all). Homesick is a phase.
        At first, I have seen friends who go home every week. These Tirupur and Erode people will make you feel jealous as going to home for
        them is way too easy. They'll be like, "Na veetuku poren di" and by the time you reach Singanallur busstand, they'll be at their home
        eating dinner. So you have to cope up with that. It would be great to go with your friends. You chit chat and then you fall asleep.
        But,on the contrary the best part about going alone is hearing songs. Never forget your headset unless you are ready to listen to 90's
        songs in the bus. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Girls out there. One important thing is that going home is easy, but the process behind it is actually difficult. There should
        be a card sent from your hometown which has details of your name,time of stay and the place. The worst part is waiting for it to come.
        It would be better if we had our own owls, just like Harry did. But that aint gonna happen. So make sure you remind your forgetful parents
        that you live far away and they have to send a card each time. Parents usually forget because they got rid of the only nuisance in the 
        house. Kidding.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Hostel teaches you a lot. </h3>
    <p> I am not going to disappoint you by telling that it is difficult to survive in a government hostel. Just think this as a demo, a
       precap of how difficult life is going to be hereafter. Trust me, you will see worse places when you go for a job later, you'll see
        dungeons but you will survive because GCT hostels will teach you. A pleasant thing to the newbies(the girls) is that your hostel is 
        brand-new and neat. It will be the best. You have geysers, neat washrooms, spacious corridors and most importantly more plug
        points. There is 6 per room rule for girls and a 3 per room for boys. As far as I know, boys hostel is a bit worse compared to the
        girls hostel. But guys usually figure out a way and they survive. No matter how the rooms are, it can be neat if you keep it neat.
        And I learnt that late. Another thing you have to take Youtube classes is on "Dress washing". This is not a great three letter university,
        so there is no laundry and you have to wash your own dresses. And there will be always someone else who starts washing just before you
        step in. So save your place and wash regularly. Again, what I learnt the hard way was if you pile up clothes, you need one whole day
        of rest after washing it. So do it in regular intervals.</p>
    <br><li> Roll Call : This is a ladies section. Roll call is just a fancy name for attendance. It happens at 6, give or take 10 mins. Don't forget
    to be present. There are worse consequences. And in this part, please believe me.</li>
